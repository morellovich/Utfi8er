# utfi8er

utfi8er is a Python GUI application designed to rename files and folder names by replacing specific German characters (e.g. '√ü', '√ú', '√ñ', '√Ñ') with their standard equivalents ('SS', 'Ue', 'Oe', 'Ae'). It also allows for customizable character replacements through a user-friendly interface.

## üéØ Purpose

- The app scans a specific user defined folder and its subfolders & files
- It then replaces the non-utf8 characters with their standard equivalents.
- The user can define the replacement rules in the GUI.
- The app will then rename all files and folders accordingly.
- The app respects the original _upper/lower case_ state.
- The user can also choose to save the original names in a log file.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Replace specific German characters with user-defined alternatives.
- Supports both folder and file renaming.
- Provides a simple interface to add new character replacements.
- Generates detailed logs of all renaming actions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/utfi8er.git
cd utfi8er
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

This project requires `tkinter` for the GUI, which is included by default in most Python installations. You'll also need `logging`, `os`, and other standard Python libraries. You can install any missing dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install tk
```

### 3. Update PATH (Optional)

Make sure your Python and `pip` executables are added to your system‚Äôs PATH to ensure the dependencies are correctly installed and can be accessed.

On **Windows**:

- Open Control Panel and go to `System > Advanced system settings > Environment Variables`.
- Select `Path` under System Variables and click Edit.
- Add the paths to your Python and `pip` installations (e.g., `C:\Python39\Scripts` and `C:\Python39\`).

## üìù How to Use

1. **Launch the Application**
   Run the script by navigating to the directory and executing:

   ```bash
   python utfi8er.py
   ```

   This will open the `German Character Replacer` GUI.

2. **Select a Folder**

   - Click the "Browse" button to select the folder containing the files and directories you wish to rename.

3. **Modify Replacement Rules**

   - The app displays default replacements for German characters: '√ü' -> 'SS', '√ú' -> 'Ue', '√ñ' -> 'Oe', '√Ñ' -> 'Ae'.
   - You can modify these by typing directly into the text fields.
   - To add new replacements, click the "Add New Replacement" button, enter the new character, and specify its replacement.

4. **Start Renaming**
   - After setting the folder and adjusting the replacement rules, click "Start Renaming".
   - The app will traverse through all files and folders in the selected directory, applying the replacements.
   - A success message will appear when the process is complete, and a log file (`renaming_log_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`) will be generated with details of all renaming actions.

## üõ°Ô∏è Logging

A log file is created with every renaming process. The file is saved in the same directory as the script and contains information like:

- Original file/folder name
- New file/folder name
- Date and time of renaming

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note

- Be cautious when using this tool, as renaming files might affect file references or dependencies in other programs.
- The app attempts to replace both uppercase and lowercase instances of the characters.
